**wxCrafter** projects are stored as a JSON file. `jsoncpp.cpp` and `json.h` are used to parse this file. The original files came from https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp using the python script on that site to create the two amalgated files. Since these files are created, rather then checked into the original repository, they were run through clang-format so that the `workflows/test_clang_format.yml` action wouldn't break. While there are no plans to change the existing parsing portion of the code, some additional functionality is needed for parsing the **wxCrafter** files. At least one of the additional methods needs access to a private data member which is not exposed via a method, so we can't access it from a derived class. Because of this, some additional members were add directly to the files with a KeyWorks Software comment to indicate what was added.
