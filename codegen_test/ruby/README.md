If you get a syntax error about `expected an `end` to close the `class` statement` it's probably because the form has one or more events declared for the class. In the wxRuby code generation, examples of the event handlers are given along with the closing end so that the developper can copy and paste the block to the end of the file. After it's pasted, they can then replace the `event.skip` with the actual code they want to handle the event. Since the generated file isn't tracked, there isn't any way to maintain a copy of the event handler.
