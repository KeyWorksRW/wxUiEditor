This directory contains files that are only built into the internal version of **wxUiEditor**. The functionality is used for testing and is built with current non-released version of wxWidgets source code. Building this version is only available on Windows, and even then only available with some internal files that allow building the non-released version of wxWidgets. If you absolutely must have access to this functionality, you will need to contact the maintainer of this repository to get the files and instructions for building the internal version of wxWidgets.
