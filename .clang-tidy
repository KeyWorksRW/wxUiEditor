# Generates way too many invalid warnings
#  -readability-implicit-bool-conversion,
#  -readability-enum-initial-value

# There are a lot of recursive calls that are automatically limited by the Node depth,
# so warning about recursive-function is not helpful. Hence
# -bugprone-recursive-function

# Between running two compilers and CodeQL, this probably isn't going to be useful
# clang-analyzer-*
