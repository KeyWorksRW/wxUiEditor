This folder assumes a `../../wxSnapshot/` repository (same level as wxUiEditor). The wxSnapshot repository contains a snapshot of the wxWidgets development branch, similar to the snapshot normally used to build wxUiEditor. Building from wxSnapshot allows testing a snapshot of the wxWidgets dev sources. If testing passes, the sources in `../wxWidgets/` can be updated from the wxSnapshot repository. This is different from the `../wxFork/` directory which is desgined to test out a change in a fork of wxWidgets which won't become part of wxSnapshot until after the fork changes get merged into the official wxWidgets repository.
