name: "Check Build"

# As of 8/13/2025 this no longer works because the target check_build creates a library that does not
# have wxWidgets libraries as a dependency. Without CMake building the wxWidgets library, the required
# wx/setup.h is never created which causes the check_build target to fail. This is the downside of using
# FetchContent.
