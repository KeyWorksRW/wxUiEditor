This directory contains files that are only built into the internal version of **wxUiEditor**. The functionality is used for testing and is built with current non-released version of wxWidgets source code. Building this version will not be possible without a special fork of the wxWidgets source code along with some additional files that must be added to your local git exlude list for the forked repository. If you absolutely must have access to this functionality, you will need to contact the maintainer of this repository to get the files and instructions for building the internal version of wxWidgets.
