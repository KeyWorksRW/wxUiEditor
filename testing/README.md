# wxUiTesting

The Mockup panel is similar to what the various wxWidgets sample apps do -- it let's you try out different settings and see what they look like. However, that doesn't tell us whether or not the code **wxUiEditor** generates will create the same thing that's being seen in the Mockup panel. **wxUiTesting** contains multiple UI elements all generated by **wxUiEditor** to verify that the generated code works as expected.

Specific dialogs can be run from the Dialogs menu. Controls in the dialog may have tooltips if certain behavior is expected so that you can verify that the control is behaving normally. In most cases, the derived dialog class will be unchanged from what `wxUiEditor` created -- normally the dialog isn't expected to do anything other than display itself. When practical, lambda's are used for event handling (created in wxUiEditor) with the goal to keep as much of the code as possible within the base class that **wxUiEditor** generates.
